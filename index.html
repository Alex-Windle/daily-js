  <h3>Closure</h3>
  <p>"When a function remembers and accesses its lexical scope even when that function is executing outside its lexical scope." -YDKJS</p>
  <p>"If you execute a function inside a function, a closure is created. Closure could return a function. Closures saves the state of the outer function variables (private vars) but do not expose them. You can hide implementation details with "encapsulation"." -ThatJSDude</p>
  <p>"Closures are frequently used in JavaScript for object data privacy, in event handlers and callback functions, and in partial applications, currying, and other functional programming patterns." -Eric Elliott</p>

  <h3>Hoisting</h3>
  <h3>Making New Objects</h3>
  <h3>Transforming an Array to an Object</h3>
  <p>Write a function called "transformEmployeeData" that transforms some employee data from one format to another.

The argument will look something like this:</p>

<p>
[
    [
        ['firstName', 'Joe'], ['lastName', 'Blow'], ['age', 42], ['role', 'clerk']
    ],
    [
        ['firstName', 'Mary'], ['lastName', 'Jenkins'], ['age', 36], ['role', 'manager']
    ]
]
</p>

<p>

Given that input, the return value should look like this:
</p>

<p>
[
    {firstName: 'Joe', lastName: 'Blow', age: 42, role: 'clerk'},
    {firstName: 'Mary', lastName: 'Jenkins', age: 36, role: 'manager'}
]
</p>

<p>
Note that the input may have a different number of rows or different keys than the given sample. 
</p>
<p>
For example, let's say the HR department adds a "tshirtSize" field to each employee record. Your code should flexibly accommodate that.
</p>
<p>
Starter Code :
</p>
<p>
function transformEmployeeData(array) {
  // your code here
}</p>
