  <h3>Closure</h3>
  <p>"When a function remembers and accesses its lexical scope even when that function is executing outside its lexical scope." -YDKJS</p>
  <p>"If you execute a function inside a function, a closure is created. Closure could return a function. Closures saves the state of the outer function variables (private vars) but do not expose them. You can hide implementation details with "encapsulation"." -ThatJSDude</p>
  <p>"Closures are frequently used in JavaScript for object data privacy, in event handlers and callback functions, and in partial applications, currying, and other functional programming patterns." -Eric Elliott</p>
